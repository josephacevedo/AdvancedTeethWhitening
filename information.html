                        An educated person is our best client. Please do your research before deciding on your teeth
                        whitening

                        treatment. Ask questions if you're not sure which treatment to choose. You do not have to do
                        anything specific

                        other than lightly brush your teeth staying away from the gum line before coming in for your
                        teeth
                        whitening

                        treatment. Please DO NOT floss before your appointment. Having your teeth cleaned and scraped
                        before
                        your

                        teeth whitening treatment may help with the process, but it is not necessary to have your teeth
                        cleaned and

                        scraped at the dentist prior to your whitening treatment.

                        We do recommend you have your usual 6 months regular check-ups at the dentist. There are many
                        causes
                        for

                        tooth staining. The most common include genetics, aging, consumption of staining substances
                        (smoking, coffee,

                        tea, and colas), tetracycline (antibiotic) staining, excessive fluoride, and old fillings.
                        Whitening
                        toothpaste can

                        remove stains that are on the outside of the teeth. Dentists call this extrinsic staining.
                        However,
                        teeth whitening

                        toothpaste and professional dental cleanings will not change the color or intrinsic staining of
                        the
                        teeth. That is

                        why teeth whitening is also sometimes called tooth bleaching is so popular.

                    Cosmetic teeth whitening is considered one of the safest and anti-aging procedures available in
                    dentistry. The

                    procedure consists of three to four 15-20 minute sessions. A fresh layer of teeth whitening gel is
                    applied after

                    each session as the old gel is removed from your teeth. Teeth Whitening works by exfoliating stains
                    from inside

                    your teeth to bring them back to their natural color. We will measure your initial shade, and the
                    final shade to

                    see how many shades lighter you got. But there is no way to predict how many shades lighter your
                    teeth will

                    get beforehand. The whitening process removes stains that we all accumulate over the years from
                    coffee, tea,

                    juice, soda, fruits, and berries, sauces, salads, etc…The final shade is your natural tooth color,
                    which is unique

                    for everyone.

                    Once Whitened, My Teeth Will Stay White Forever

                <p class="line-height">

                    Unfortunately this is not true! The effects of your lifestyle will have an impact on how quickly and
                    how

                    much your teeth will stain again. Eating fruits and vegetables, drinking red wine, coffees, dark
                    sodas, tea

                    and smoking will cause your teeth to stain your teeth more quickly than going without these foods.

                    But it isn’t all bad news; it is unlikely that your teeth will stain back to the point where they
                    were before

                    your treatment. And, to help counteract the fact that your teeth will stain again, we recommend
                    having

                    your teeth whitened every 3 to 6 months so you can keep your pearly whites. In the meantime, try

                    drinking those staining liquids through a straw and by rinsing your mouth with water after every
                    meal

                    will help keep those pesky stains away.

                <p class="line-height">
                    By now, you probably know that certain lifestyle choices lead to your teeth staining. Drinking
                    coffee and

                    tea, poor oral hygiene, dark sodas and smoking are the top lifestyle choices that can lead to teeth

                    discoloration. But, if these are not things you have issues with and are still struggling with
                    yellow teeth,

                    chances are, the issue is a little deeper than that. Generally, people can have different shades of
                    teeth. The

                    hue is mainly determined by the dentin (the second layer of hard tissue and typically softer than
                    the

                    enamel); enamel is in fact translucent, hence the underlying dentin, which is yellow, reflects so
                    the color

                    seen is usually light yellow. Discolored dentin could be caused by multiple factors, ie: medications
                    and

                    your genetics. Having a thin enamel layer on your teeth will also cause the dentin layer to show
                    through

                    more clearly. Even in the same individual, the different types of teeth can have different shades.
                    For

                    instance, the canine has more bulk of dentin and thus appears more yellowish than the others. Even
                    in a

                    single tooth, the color varies. The part of the tooth closer to the gum appears more yellowish than
                    the part

                    close to the edge. The good news is that there is still a way to whiten your teeth even if your
                    dentin layer

                    is to blame for yellow teeth. Our whitening process whitens all the way down to the dentin layer, by

                    gently lifting the stains one layer at the time. Allowing your teeth to look brighter and whiter!

                <h4 class="text-center mt-4">What Makes Tea Stain Your Teeth</h4>
                <p class="line-height">
                    Tannins are natural chemicals that give plants defense against hungry, leaf-eaters (like yourself),
                    according to

                    Scientific American. They also happen to be what gives the tea the deep, complex flavor that you
                    know and

                    love. They may taste great, but they're what gives your tea that dark color that clings to your
                    white enamel (the

                    outer layer of your teeth), leaving stains and dulling your smile. When it comes to drinks, it's not
                    just the darker

                    hues you have to look out for. There are some light-colored culprits too. White tea can erode your
                    enamel and

                    white wine is even more acidic than red! Try to limit your intake. When you do have them, swish with
                    water to

                    get off as much residue as you can. Whenever possible, use a straw to limit the liquid's contact
                    with your teeth.
